# ATOC 214 Single Slab Atmosphere Model
This repo is simply a copy of the ATOC214 single slab atmosphere model I made. The model is meant to be distributed to students who can make changes to variables in the code to emulate different conditions on earth, or try to replicating scenarios like the climate of mars. 

### Notice
I know this code is not written particularly optimally. A big part of the way is written is to have it be as legible as possible. This is to prevent ostracising students taking ATOC214who have no background in programming. I am aware that there are more efficient ways to write this!
