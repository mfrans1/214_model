# ATOC 214 Single Slab Atmosphere Model

## Introduction
This repo is simply a copy of the ATOC214 single slab atmosphere model I made. The model is meant to be distributed to students who can make changes to variables in the code to emulate different conditions on earth, or try to replicating scenarios like the climate of mars. It was used in a lecture, as well as a component of one of the homework assignments.  

## Files
There are two versions of the same model, one is a jupyter notebook type document that is more legible, and is useful for lectures. I used this version in my guest lecture, each section builds on the last in a way that is (intended to be) intuitive. Then there is the second version of the same model which is just a python script. The model uses some basic packages most people will have installed already (numpy and matplotlib for example). 

### Notice
I know this code is not written particularly optimally. A big part of the way is written is to have it be as legible as possible. This is to prevent ostracising students taking ATOC214 who have no background in programming. I am aware that there are more efficient ways to write this!
